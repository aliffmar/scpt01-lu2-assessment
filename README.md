## data.js
Will contain the data layer?
* It's all the code that pertain to creating, retreiving, deleting and modifying your 'database' (collection of data)
  * for example if doing a todolist, then the database will be a collection of all tasks
  * this means my data layer will have functions to add a task, retrieve all the
    tasks, modifying an existing task and deleting a task.
